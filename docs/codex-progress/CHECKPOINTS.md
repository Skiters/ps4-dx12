# Checkpoints

## Current separate plane boundary checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Production e384ca5f8fcd78ee811559b0001be238e8276387 connects separate D/S boundary maps, plane enumeration for retained/released watches/faults, all-plane reprotection-before-read and failure-safe proof retention. Actual CPU PageWatch faults and6 related GPU fixtures pass, including24 I/private/I cases rejecting unvalidated S boundaries. This is bounded boundary infrastructure evidence; split independent ownership acquisition/rollback, paired independent conversion and retirement remain explicit code gaps. Clean committed Release18-file folder F:/PS4Dev/handoff/paired-plane-watches-20261017/artifacts-e384ca5, EXE597164fada941c9e38ffad9dd51e50004d0ae3650a8482a6941a40acc562324d;54 dependencies/2283 inputs/zero primary paths. Current whole-core/game acceptance not_run. Prior f0d047a/a2acbc3 captures and all exact evidence remain intact. SESSION_HANDOFF.md first section is authoritative. No automatic kernel installation/selection or user/game/session action. Full port remains active;129 implementation/verification records/nine broader gaps retained. Older sections are history.


## Current native depth/stencil I capture checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Production f0d047a7f48880a7cc6bcd6b08cef00710c2cc26 connects ordinary valid GPU-owned native depth/stencil I -> private D/S buffers -> native I, including MSAA/D16 conversion, prewrite DrawInternal source selection, nonpublication and real fence leases. Followup a2acbc3939d5b44664ddb2d64f66489534320362 exposes the complete private allocation capacity to residency and preserves available seed padding.9 scoped GPU fixtures pass at exact f0d047a binaries; the strengthened24-case full-capacity/held-fence fixture separately passes at exact a2acbc3 binary. Whole core/game/paired PageWatch ownership are not accepted. Primary and separate clean committed Release link; complete18-file manual-folder kernel is F:/PS4Dev/handoff/native-depth-capture-20261017/artifacts-a2acbc3 (EXE SHA256 5f68fb406981e74ab21778c247d5af8a315e14bbe65b969e2294e2cb11d1a609).54 pinned dependencies/2283 inputs/zero primary paths. No automatic app install/selection or game/user-process action. Authoritative continuation and limitations: SESSION_HANDOFF.md first section. Next production work is paired per-plane PageWatch/ownership/boundary proofs/retirement; retain existing split-independent rejection until the whole lifecycle is connected.129 registry rows and nine broader gap IDs remain distinct from verification. Older sections are historical.


## Current paired depth snapshot / portable stencil checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Production `99cb1f467b8af8d19ea95f21343c482247e4095a` connects separate CPU/GPU depth/stencil inputs to UploadVersion and DrawInternal prewrite snapshots, including MSAA. GPU B1 inputs use physical preparation without replaying shader-buffer binding effects; both native input capacities/lifetimes are accounted, and GPU planes never become CPU equality witnesses. GuestMultisample now uploads stencil without optional SV_StencilRef through eight fixed write-mask bit passes (plus rectangle-only zero pass for partial uploads), preserving depth and outside samples; supported hardware keeps the single-pass path. Nine scoped fixtures pass, including24 actual paired cases with no skips on device10de:2c02/PSStencilRef=0 and formerly skipped partial MSAA stencil controls. Whole GuestRasterizer prewrite acceptance, source I-to-private paired capture, independent multi-plane PageWatch/ownership/pressure and final gameplay remain open. Complete primary/clean committed Release built;54 dependencies,2283 inputs, zero primary paths. Runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/paired-depth-snapshot-20261017/artifacts-99cb1f4`, EXE `612bfc73b93fbff7af48bb046a173b61c87c02ae89ad1dceeaade44965509dc1`, PDB `afa2720a0b21bfbfe8509cb03391c974eadb117ecf84f0f957681cf99d1bf055`; proofs H=`F:/PS4Dev/handoff/paired-depth-snapshot-20261017`.129 implementation/behavior rows and nine broader gap IDs remain. SESSION_HANDOFF is authoritative; continue I-plane capture and paired ownership, not another129-group audit. No game/UI/XInput/profiler or auto-install/selection/user-process restart.


## Current single-plane depth / mip-prefix checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Production `36f137329816f19ced7daa0069bca2f798234019` connects independent single-sample D16/D32 depth with resident B, readonly native depth views, ordered formatted retile and compact depth readback/linear retirement. Split stencil/MSAA depth and shader-writable shared depth/color remain explicit gaps. A regression also fixed missing valid smaller-mip I selection in FindIndependentUploadSource; all48 ordered-stage cases pass with unchanged expected values. Eight scoped fixtures pass, including six D16/D32 GPU configurations plus independent native-plane copy oracles, both I/B directions, B0/B1/padding and fence negatives; alias additionally passes with exact core runtime converter. Primary and clean committed Release linked7.58s/20.44s (primary code compilation14.04s beforehand);54 pinned dependencies,2283 inputs, zero primary paths. Complete external runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/independent-depth-plane-20261017/artifacts-36f1373`, EXE `16a7f3050fdab7473cef2a41390e5de01ee49fa675ece2b6e71e0f16cb0b53b3`, PDB `63e65f281ad0db0603b0bb697a27d9394c98a392a4915237dc4d899568b2f49b`. Evidence H=`F:/PS4Dev/handoff/independent-depth-plane-20261017`. RHI proof does not establish GuestRasterizer/PageWatch depth end-to-end or current-core/game/FPS/final-suite acceptance.129 separate implementation/behavior records and nine broad gap IDs remain; SESSION_HANDOFF is authoritative. Next: connected split-stencil/MSAA-depth I/B planes, ownership and retirement; preserve pinned formatted depth-only aspect semantics. No repeated129-group audit, automatic kernel installation/selection or user-process restart.


## Latest readonly sharp / DMA alias proof — 2026-10-17

Test commit9fdd733 executes the pinned readonly SSBO + writable SSBO + ReadConst/DMA live-B contract in standalone and linked production conversion. The input's binding5 NonWritable decoration is checked; the native reflected binding is a live UAV, and readonly sharp and DMA observe the same-dispatch0xdbca0000+lane writes over prior GPU B1=0x22334455. Both fixture and exact core runtime converters pass the complete scoped DMA test. Evidence F:/PS4Dev/handoff/readonly-dma-alias-20261017/NATIVE_VERIFICATION_9fdd733.json. The prior queued actual reflected SRV/DMA conflict is covered for the production path: NativeOptions already enables native_storage_buffer_uavs, standalone/linked conversions apply it and shader cache keys include it. The incompatible custom SRV/UAV guard and original negative controls remain. No new fallback/snapshot is needed or permitted for true same-command aliases. Production core and16-case pressure evidence remain2e01aa6; the new commit changes only the fixture. Nine broader gap IDs/129 rows remain. **Next production mechanism: ordered opaque depth/stencil I/B transfers**, starting at guest_texture_cache.cpp::UploadVersion and guest_rasterizer.cpp::SetIndependentVersionTransfer callback. Keep existing exact-base/reference residency semantics, separate planes, masks, CPU B0 and ordering/lifetime. SESSION_HANDOFF remains authoritative.


## Current persistent buffer backing checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Production33a1e87/1ef3129/`2e01aa67acb768a1bfa58068a058e5912c4c05ae` retains mandatory GPU-derived B1 and selected native generations through cache pressure, matching pinned Vulkan persistent resident backing. Reconstructible entries alone are evicted; callback-safe victims are elected in one sorted pass. Soft cache targets admit mandatory guest contents; actual new native commitment still obeys freshly queried adapter availability and the existing reserve. Placed heap growth uses remaining budget and compacts against the current page target. Sixteen scoped GPU/readback cases plus alias/DMA with the exact core runtime converter pass. Primary and clean committed Release linked15.77s/23.09s;54 pinned dependencies,2283 compile inputs, zero primary-checkout paths. Manual-folder runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/preserved-buffer-budget-20261017/artifacts-2e01aa6`; EXE `c235fad68b7cd572658514d3c154007daf7878729d68229e315f09d05e579811`, PDB `c4f20f688c4f13e092c1388eed8f99933f5806037b6db3ce6d9c59b92cac3aed`. Proofs: `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/preserved-buffer-budget-20261017/RELEASE_PROOF_2e01aa6.json` and `NATIVE_VERIFICATION_2e01aa6-final.json`. No current-core/game/FPS acceptance or auto-install/selection.129 independent implementation/behavior records and nine broader gap IDs remain; SESSION_HANDOFF is authoritative. Next: settle the actual reflected SRV/DMA-UAV production path (production converters already unify SSBOs), then ordered opaque depth/stencil I/B transfers. Do not repeat the global audit or completed ownership/DMA/disjoint/pressure work.


## Current disjoint native buffer-view checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Production `a39144a72db03df98836296d64d8c319afc6d01e` preserves one complete canonical B for disjoint native SRV/UAV byte ranges sharing preceding GPU-only/owned backing. Readonly native SRVs receive leased GPU copies refreshed at final binding; original UAV writes, CPU baselines, PageWatch, dirty ranges and semantic residency stay in canonical B. True overlapping native SRV/UAV ranges retain compiler-unification requirements; production standalone/linked guest SSBO conversion already unifies them. Eleven scoped GPU/readback cases plus alias/DMA with the exact core runtime converter pass. Complete primary and separate clean Release linked;54 pinned dependencies,2283 compile inputs, zero primary checkout inputs. Current external manual-folder runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/disjoint-buffer-views-20261017/artifacts-a39144a`, EXE `d7f6dc266b0e30defb7d1bc4a8e71fb321d9208b6ed85ad50ab252a37f4d56c1`, PDB `e0478710fc8f00d52e3d1d9e5ee2fa9389fe3edf0ab12a6dff95bc4e2c6e92e6`. H=`F:/PS4Dev/handoff/disjoint-buffer-views-20261017`, RELEASE_PROOF_a39144a.json/NATIVE_VERIFICATION.json. No current-core/game/FPS acceptance or automatic installation/selection. Full goal remains unfinished:129 implementation/behavior rows, nine broader gap IDs. Next: inactive GPU-only B pressure backing in Find/PrepareShaderBuffersImpl; preserve B1, CPU B0/store proofs and actual fence leases. SESSION_HANDOFF.md is authoritative; no repeated global audit or completed alias/DMA investigation.


## Current owned-envelope / pending-DMA checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Authoritative continuation is the newest SESSION_HANDOFF.md section. Production `51ec0979800b23ae647c0d779714085bf251ea8c` fixes the formerly failing large-DMA no-submit regression: protected GPU-owned B grows through ordered GPU copies, inherited exact dirty ranges and acquired gap guards, retaining old guards/resources and separate CPU snapshots. Unprotected sources, actual CPU-store markers and rejected gap acquisition retain the necessary reconciliation path. No wait/exception/assertion is suppressed. RunLargePacket already had ownership callbacks; the earlier missing-callback hypothesis was disproved by source inspection and captured Finish stacks.

Eleven scoped GPU/readback cases pass, including the unchanged native_copy_dirty_ranges fence/data/source/padding/neighbor/GDS oracle. Extended actual PageWatch controls prove NOACCESS/pending writes, explicit-read visibility, joining two owned B versions, gap rejection, throwing acquisition/retry, new-guard rollback and a CPU winner in provisional backing. Original expected B0/B1/dirty-byte values remain; owned tests now request CPU visibility explicitly instead of requiring premature reconciliation. Related DMA shader, independent I/B, lifetime, graphics DMA/IA and final-view cases pass; native_gpu_page_ownership passes35.96s. Exact runtime converter DMA additionally passes; regular fixture/runtime converter identities remain distinct. NATIVE_VERIFICATION.json contains per-binary archives. No whole-core/game/FPS acceptance is inferred.

Primary Release and separate clean committed Release compiled/linked (16.77s/26.74s),54 pinned dependencies,2283 compile inputs, zero primary checkout paths. Complete manual-folder runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/dma-copy-pending-20261017/artifacts-51ec097`, EXE `1dcac40a16056641481eb4aba137f4e9cce36dbd31b37c6dad4993099d275e16`, PDB `897981a79c38b9648e7c258a10ec3b8be5b0049508ea72c624d8efc192076970`; RELEASE_PROOF_51ec097.json. Evidence H=`F:/PS4Dev/handoff/dma-copy-pending-20261017`; all earlier builds/failures/baselines retained. No game/app/UI/XInput/profiler execution, automatic installation/selection or user-process restart.

Full goal remains unfinished:129 implementation/behavior rows, nine broader gap IDs. Next production source action: clipped GPU-only envelopes at RematerializeBufferEnvelope and incompatible simultaneous native SRV/UAV classes in PrepareShaderBuffersImpl, using the pinned one-arena contents/order contract. Inactive GPU-only B pressure storage, actual reflected SRV/DMA-UAV conflict, ordered opaque I/B, converted/shifted/clipped domains and other IDs remain. Do not repeat the now-fixed pending-DMA investigation, original crash replay or129-group audit. Final suite/expanded XInput gameplay and real-frame FPS baseline comparison remain final.


## Current initial-DMA / private-index / GPU-fill checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Authoritative continuation: newest SESSION_HANDOFF.md section. Production fcb67e1 separates raw DMA physical backing from real shader stage requests and adds one-shot/failure-safe ResourceBindings::Prepare before IA selection;2d5e107 connects original clean <=16KiB private physical CPU index streams and late resident auxiliary selection;7a59dd26410aa2ba29b38d8fd1845af8b90c44fa routes GPU FillBuffer through writable preserving preparation. Original B0/B1/I contents, exact writes, semantic residency, read states and fence leases remain distinct. No game/app/UI/XInput/profiler execution, automatic installation/selection or user-process restart occurred.

At2d5e107,12 scoped native GPU/readback cases passed; binaries/logs/compiler inputs are archived in `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/initial-physical-dma-20261017/native-fixtures-2d5e107`, NATIVE_VERIFICATION_2d5e107.json. At7a59dd2, the extended envelope/watch/fill case and DMA shader case pass; **native_copy_dirty_ranges fails** on `DMA submitted the pending guest list` in RunLargePacket. Its earlier exact-write/overlap/retry cases pass. Preserve this negative fence oracle. No FillBuffer call occurs in that failing scenario; fixture ownership/preparation and envelope-growth submission boundaries still need isolation. No claim that all checks pass. Both phases additionally pass DMA with their exact core runtime converter (different from the regular fixture converter); identities are separate. This is mechanism evidence, not whole-core/game/FPS acceptance.

Primary and separate clean committed Release compiled/linked at7a59dd2;54 pinned dependencies,2283 compile inputs, zero primary checkout inputs, clean source tree. Complete external runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/initial-physical-dma-20261017/artifacts-7a59dd2`; EXE `d36c1bc70de83680065959280ff186234a633b6bb7d392c6516e2913fdc0ce5d`, PDB `b6e24ac5d5e8e7add719f4ad01ce5a0432dd2b942cef78beefa27f514f28d7b3`. RELEASE_PROOF_7a59dd2.json and NATIVE_VERIFICATION_7a59dd2.json preserve exact identities and the failure. Old fcb67e1/2d5e107 runtimes and all older artifacts remain. Never auto-install/select cores.

Full goal remains unfinished:129 implementation/behavior rows, nine broader gap IDs. Next production task is the large DMA pending-list regression in CopyBufferBatchImpl/PrepareShaderBuffersImpl/RematerializeBufferEnvelope; then remaining mixed native SRV/UAV splitting, inactive GPU-only B pressure backing, ordered opaque I/B and converted/shifted/clipped transfer domains. Do not restart the129-group audit, original crash replay, or completed raw-DMA/private-index mechanism. Full suite and expanded final XInput/game/real-frame baseline comparison remain final.


## Current final-buffer / physical-DMA checkpoint — 2026-10-17

This section supersedes older current/next statements; SESSION_HANDOFF.md remains authoritative. Source9791682 selects native buffer descriptors only after attachment preparation and validates original ranges against explicit full-copy allocation ancestry. Source0d5b4693e0784bdc7e01aaa9db2d6b2275851367 materializes missing legal64KiB/4KiB DMA backing from physical B before that final selection, preserving independent I and preceding GPU B1. Existing initialized backing is not rescanned here; BindResident retains its strict guard and single post-stage synchronization. Stage effects/private streams/bounds/CPU visibility/fence leases remain.

Nine related native fixtures passed (envelope/ownership/generations, DMA, two new graphics late-growth/private-snapshot controls, readonly and UAV indexed draw, independent I/B, buffer-view lifetime and scheduler lifetime). DMA additionally passed with the exact runtime Mesa converter; its normal fixture converter has a distinct hash despite identical pinned source/patch metadata, so identities/results are recorded separately. Complete primary and separate clean Release compiled/linked;54 dependencies,2283 compile inputs, zero primary-source inputs in clean build. Runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/attachment-backing-20261017/artifacts-0d5b469`, EXE `abfa3efbf468e2e6ce24e001e172e4842e602e0f818da658ff07c9daa98a151e`, PDB `4a83d098e0106176d831a306c3bafb4879145e7b2a592a1901e57d08060fe4e0`; exact core runtime/game/FPS acceptance not_run. Evidence `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/attachment-backing-20261017`, RELEASE_PROOF_0d5b469.json and NATIVE_VERIFICATION_0d5b469.json. No game/app/UI/XInput/profiler run, core auto-install/selection or user-process restart this continuation.

Full port remains unfinished:129 implementation/behavior records, nine gap IDs. Next: initial opaque DMA request batches still call the legacy CPU image resolution path before ordinary shader preparation. Separate their physical B intent without dropping real shader-buffer BindBuffers effects, then adapt ordered opaque depth/stencil I/B domains. Direct Find, mixed SRV/UAV split, pressure B backing, private IA/auxiliary and other existing gap IDs remain. Do not redo the completed final-view or late physical-materialization mechanism, original crash replay or129-group audit.


## Current crash / GPU-contract checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Authoritative current state: SESSION_HANDOFF.md, crash evidence `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/breakpoint-crash-d01969e-20261016T234433Z`. This section supersedes older current/next claims and the old all-tests-deferred policy. Narrow regression and GPU/readback checks are now authorized; full suite and expanded gameplay acceptance remain final. No per-commit game launches, automatic core installation/selection, original Vulkan/save changes or user-app restart.

Production935fb69 restores existing prepared writable B ownership after prewrite reads/Finish, without replacing selected resources or bypassing the ownership assertion; fatal messages synchronously reach stderr/log and the launcher captures per-launch streams/manifest/hex exit/report. db0812c preserves signed integer clear bits through compatible UINT views and explicit UAV ordering. Production8fb9c79 reserves complete legal DMA backing for late image sources in ordered common native I/B domains before final views, preserving original semantic publication phases.

The original exactd01969e replay trapped in ExecuteGuestBufferCompute: `Independent image version lost its writable buffer ownership before execution`, followed by Liverpool coroutine UNREACHABLE -> int3. Original EXE/PDB/runtime, profile copy, logs, exception/context/stacks and dump are preserved. The exact935fb69 clean binary survived a120s bounded diagnostic startup exposure without this exception; its owned tree was stopped at deadline. No world/input/pixel/FPS acceptance, and that result is not transferred to8fb9c79.

Six exact native fixture binaries are preserved with PASS records in `narrow-regressions-8fb9c79.json`: envelope/semantic B, DMA (including late image full/partial backing), independent I/B, buffer view lifetime, scheduler lifetime and PageWatch/GPU ownership. The latter also covers typed/converted image clears and gated resource lifetime;34.08s, not the former20s budget. Normalized half ties have tightly specified alternatives; original expected bytes/negative checks/padding remain. Clean committed Release at8fb9c79ea55c8a71d5befebffa0797de98f59523,54 pinned dependencies,2283 compile inputs, zero primary checkout inputs. Full runtime `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/breakpoint-crash-d01969e-20261016T234433Z/artifacts-8fb9c79`; EXE SHA256 `3e822bf2a7c46fcc8c8c7dc242c36df4ba895f65ce8dbd7ae03be1032f5a0fab`, PDB `765be1db16d597c59bd40f376e511e8a763d13dd0fd4cdbe18893dfb8c6a8e09`. This exact core is not game-tested or automatically installed.

Full port is unfinished:129 independent implementation/behavior records, nine gap IDs retained. Next: extend pre-view source-footprint/backing planning beyond ordered common I/B domains to attachment-only/converted/BC/opaque source receipts; inspect GuestRasterizer::Draw submit_replay and ExecuteGuestResources before changing final views. Keep existing native identity/SRV-UAV/ownership guards. Direct Find/mixed-class/pressure B backing and private IA/auxiliary unification remain. App DLL was locked by the active user process: old DLL/PDB pair remains installed, new diagnostics pair staged; no process restart. Apply script/details in SESSION_HANDOFF.md.


## Current image-source publication checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production `2498c6fafe567e13a6b8fe71937aa967a1632b9b` connects version-specific image B-source residency: prewarm/capture reserves physical backing and retains deferred effects; actual image binding consumes them, including inherited independent I conversions and prewrite shader/depth/stencil sources. Publication preserves retry state, discards overwritten-version effects, checks existing source backing and does not replace native views. Primary and separate clean committed Release linked; six fixture TUs passed C++ /Zs in each checkout. All new runtime/shader/GPU/game/XInput/UI/FPS acceptance remains not_run.129 independent implementation/behavior records and nine gap IDs remain. Latest complete external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/image-source-publication-20261017/artifacts-2498c6f. Do not auto-install/select. Next: complete legal tiny DMA backing before final selected views, preserve GPU B/witnesses/fence leases, then the existing source-gap queue. SESSION_HANDOFF.md is authoritative; older sections preserve history.


## Current semantic B residency checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production `d01969e9e7c5cb5336b3937f4f2c9aa85b35f768` separates shader-buffer semantic residency from physical DEFAULT preallocation, publishes original buffers in bind order, and masks formatted I-to-B copies to the pages resident at that point. Clean small shader reads use private full DWORD envelopes; host/domain reservations and private I conversion captures do not publish pages. Final refreshed images consume masked B, with selected native states restored. Primary and clean committed Release linked; five fixture TUs passed C++ /Zs in both checkouts. All new runtime/GPU/game/XInput/UI/FPS results remain not_run. Full port unfinished;129 implementation/behavior records and nine gap IDs retained. Latest full external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/semantic-buffer-residency-20261017/artifacts-d01969e. Do not auto-install/select cores. SESSION_HANDOFF.md is authoritative; older sections preserve history.


## Current preserving B growth checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production558baa3/f16630d preserves complete preceding GPU B ranges, old CPU snapshots, forced CPU-store pages and RO witnesses across compatible batch envelope growth. Only new holes initialize from physical B; old allocations survive the copy fence. Existing actual guest-write reconciliation remains. Primary and separate clean committed Release linked; five fixture TUs passed C++ /Zs only, no new runtime/GPU/game/XInput/UI or FPS result. Latest full external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/buffer-envelope-preservation-20261017/artifacts-f16630d. Never auto-install/select it. Full port remains unfinished: semantic DMA residency publication, tiny full-subpage materialization and stable final views, direct/split/pressure B residency, auxiliary SRV unification, opaque depth/stencil and the existing nine-gap queue remain.

Authoritative proof and exact continuation: SESSION_HANDOFF.md. Older continuation entries retain history.


## Current invalid-I pressure checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production `284be47d1bfacd32bdc8a871759bf6953a1edcf4` connects pressure eviction of invalid independent I without downloading stale pixels into physical B. Actual cache admission shares ReclaimResidentMemory with ReserveMemory; preserve pins, completion, callback identity and budget refresh are retained. Primary and separate clean committed Release linked; five fixture TUs passed C++ /Zs only. No new runtime/GPU/game/XInput/UI execution or FPS result. Latest full external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/invalid-image-pressure-20261017/artifacts-284be47. Never auto-install/select it. Valid GPU-modified tiled I remains excluded from pressure download by the pinned Vulkan rule; older broad statements calling that exclusion a gap are superseded. Late tiny DMA materialization/stable B residency, SRV auxiliary unification, opaque depth/stencil and existing nine-gap queue remain unfinished.129 implementation/behavior records and prior behavior evidence are retained.

Authoritative evidence and exact C++ continuation: SESSION_HANDOFF.md. Older current/next sections preserve history.


## Current late resident DMA checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production `7cc493f72c96a0492cc165166987ad4c7f38fa88` publishes fully materialized late DMA pages at BeforeBind: complete64KiB pages or4KiB subpages, exact existing mapping/offset coverage, original selected-view identity guards, no reservation/retile, single CPU-dirty B synchronization and placed-allocation retention. Primary and clean committed Release linked; four fixture TUs passed C++ /Zs only. No new runtime/GPU/game/XInput/UI execution. Latest external full runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/late-dma-publication-20261017/artifacts-7cc493f. Never auto-install/select it. Remaining: complete-page materialization for tiny late sharps, late arena replacement, auxiliary SRV/UAV unification, opaque depth/stencil and tiled independent pressure/retirement, then existing converted/shifted/clipped/nine-gap backlog.129 groups remain separate implementation/behavior records:59 with concrete gaps,70 without a separately established production change. Full port remains unfinished.

This section supersedes older continuation entries. Exact evidence and next source action: SESSION_HANDOFF.md.


## Current planned resident DMA checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production50bdc81/a564b6c/34232f8 connect synchronization of already planned resident DMA B after image binding, preserve CPU streams and physical guest backing, and safely borrow/release PageWatch image/buffer witnesses. Opaque depth/stencil retains the legacy exclusive-image/physical-backing path; it is not completed independent transfer. Primary and separate clean committed Release linked at34232f8. For these changes runtime/GPU/game/XInput/UI tests are not_run; fixture TUs passed C++ /Zs only. Earlier behavior evidence is retained. Latest full external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/ordered-dma-sync-20261017/artifacts-34232f8. Never auto-install/select cores. Next: stable late DMA residency/table publication before final native descriptors; then remaining opaque/tiled-pressure/converted/shifted transfer guards. Registry:129 groups,59 connected_with_known_gaps,70 with no separately established change, nine broader gap IDs. The DMA group now explicitly records the proven late-page implementation gap; unrun behavior is separate. Full port remains unfinished.

This section supersedes older current/next entries; full evidence and exact continuation: SESSION_HANDOFF.md.


## Per-stage source/build checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production1678638 connects original per-stage BindBuffers -> BindTextures effects for common native I/B allocations, intermediate image refreshes, initial cache-prefix retile, clean private streams and final exact-base invalidation. Primary and clean committed Release linked;48 authored helper transfer/cache controls and existing GCN/alias TUs are C++ typechecked only. No runtime/GPU/game/XInput execution. Latest external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/ordered-graphics-stages-20261017/artifacts-1678638. Remaining ordered DMA synchronization, converted/BC domains, shifted geometry and reader-arena clipping stay explicit in the nine-gap registry. Next: the ordered_stages&&uses_dma guard, GuestDmaMemory::AppendRequests/RecordFaults and pinned BufferCache::SynchronizeDmaBuffers. Full evidence/continuation: SESSION_HANDOFF.md. Never auto-install/select new cores; full port remains unfinished.

No new FPS/frame-time/stability/image acceptance result. Primary build command-20261017-023704-34592.log; clean023731-30028; clean alias/GCN syntax023809-33988 /023809-30108, all in F:/Codex-Shared/devtools/logs. Saved runtime baselines remain authoritative.


## Partial-page image source/build checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Production7420e32 connects partial-page independent image retention: page protection envelopes, complete physical-B boundary witnesses, lazy rearm-before-compare, CPU-winner preservation and nested pre-store deferral. Exact-base GPU invalidation and distinct I/B versions remain. Primary and separate clean Release linked; PageWatch/alias/GCN TUs C++ typechecked only. Runtime/game/XInput acceptance is not_run. Latest full external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/partial-image-watch-20261017/artifacts-7420e32. Full evidence/continuation: SESSION_HANDOFF.md. Next: multi-stage BindBuffers/BindTextures ordering at ExecuteGuestResources guards444/618, then remaining shifted-geometry/nine-gap backlog. No auto-install/select or full-port completion claim.

No FPS/frame-time measurement was performed. Saved baseline remains authoritative; this is source/build verification only. Primary build command-20261017-021650-23600.log; clean build021720-34568; clean PageWatch/alias/GCN syntax021825-70668 /021825-21280 /021825-13728, all in F:/Codex-Shared/devtools/logs.


## Current shader mip-prefix checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Productione780a6a connects shared maximum uncompressed mip backing, cached I-tail/provenance retention, original SRV/UAV/LOD bounds and pre-view growth plus ordered B1-prefix+B0-tail snapshots. Stage metadata27. Primary and clean Release linked; prefix/identity/classification controls C++ typechecked only, no tests/game. Latest external runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/shader-mip-prefix-20261017/artifacts-e780a6a. Full evidence/continuation: SESSION_HANDOFF.md. Next: partial-page independent image ownership/protection envelopes and shared-page CPU-fault guards; current retention limits, multi-stage and shifted geometry gaps remain. No auto-install/select or full-port completion claim.


## Current physical image identity checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Productionb85f076 replaces whole-T# alias identity with explicit pinned physical storage fields, covering ignored control/counter/reserved differences and reusing existing coherent UAV/manual-sampling paths. Stage metadata26. Primary and clean Release linked; alias/classification TUs C++ typechecked, no test/GPU/game execution. Latest external runtime F:/PS4Dev/handoff/image-storage-identity-20261017/artifacts-b85f076; full evidence/continuation in SESSION_HANDOFF.md. Next: connect same-base compatible uncompressed mip-prefix aliases through metadata, maximum shared backing and original view ranges before relaxing geometry guards. Nine broader gaps remain; no auto-install/select and no full-port completion claim.


## Current mixed-version checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Productionc238eef connects single-stage mixed formatted buffer/image versions with compatible physical layouts: interior W retains I; an exact-base W after retile refreshes images from B1, with final-copy-before-shader-read barriers. Primary and clean committed Release linked;32 new GCN controls are C++ typechecked only. Latest runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/mixed-image-buffer-ordering-20261017/artifacts-c238eef. Full identity/evidence/continuation: SESSION_HANDOFF.md. Next: overlapping image SRV/UAV access unification (the still-live ExecuteGuestResources guard, pinned force_general); multi-stage ordering and other existing gaps remain. Never auto-install/select cores; renderer/game/XInput execution is still deferred. No new FPS or full-port acceptance claim.


## Current narrow-writer checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Production6a7dff0/7304bb2 connects exact original-sharp shader bounds (CBV space34, metadata25) and naturally aligned contained byte/halfword writer envelopes in the existing compute-only common-UAV image domain. Primary and clean committed Release passed;16 additional GCN controls are C++ typechecked, not executed. Full runtime: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/native-buffer-bounds-20261017/artifacts-7304bb2; identity/evidence and precise remaining source entry point are in SESSION_HANDOFF.md. The nine broader backlog IDs remain; no runtime/FPS acceptance or full-port completion is claimed. Do not auto-install/select cores. Next: remaining mixed image/buffer shared storage and ownership in ExecuteGuestResources; keep existing guards until adapted. Builds are allowed; final renderer/game/XInput tests remain deferred.


## Current ordered interior writer checkpoint — 2026-10-17

Manual-folder policy remains authoritative: never automatically install/select new core builds. The folder selector is installed in PS4Desktop.exe; source48396fd/a545b9f, installation evidence desktop-folder-core-20261017. No renderer/game test or user UI automation was run.

Production commit `daa76fc50a3d07978a8804d7a6e3646dbe4c647a` extends ExecuteGuestResources for contained DWORD interior buffer writers in a single compute-stage, buffer-only common-UAV image domain. Pinned TextureCache::InvalidateMemoryFromGPU dirties I only at the original exact sharp base. Binding order now compares the first such writer, so an earlier offset writer can leave I eligible for formatted retile. Every small CPU-clean readonly stream remains private, even after a writer on another page. Full prewrite I/B snapshot, physical padding, original descriptor bounds/dirty ranges, pins and fence callbacks stay. The prepared transfer is consumed after buffer preparation without reselecting a potentially invalidated logical entry.

Eight real-GCN controls extend gcn_ordered_formatted_fixture.h: R/W and W/R, small/large, clean/dirty B, I != B, later formatted reread, retained I probes, exact four-byte writer/out-of-bounds store and full64KiB physical/padding oracle. They are authored, not executed. C++ /Zs passed for the containing GCN fixture and BC volume fixture with actual Release include/define/toolchain inputs in both primary and clean checkouts. This is typechecking only, not DXIL conversion/fixture link/GPU acceptance. Renamed local small/far identifiers in two fixture headers after real SDK macro errors; no SDK macro was disabled.

Incremental primary Release and clean committed Release both compiled/linked (exit0). Clean source has no tracked dirt and its2282 compile commands contain no primary checkout input. Saved complete EXE/PDB/runtime/compiler/licenses: `F:/PS4Dev/handoff/ordered-offset-writers-20261017/artifacts-daa76fc`. EXE SHA256 `74e783a09fd2e3ed5f7695235acf4eefa99bd515f7e9d4d7d9b21abcb599b9b3`; PDB `a1a1cf1446a8f6603e3f1e0bd359055149868b5cc3282bd7984aa3d553ff6d26`. It is untested in game and not installed/selected. Old6cbaef7 artifacts remain unchanged.

Exact evidence: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/ordered-offset-writers-20261017/, RELEASE_PROOF.json, release-identity.json, source-before-commit.patch/manifest, original and clean fixture response/command files. Build log command-20261017-010800-71224.log; clean GCN/BC syntax logs command-20261017-010938-20920.log / command-20261017-010938-72452.log. Logs are in F:/Codex-Shared/devtools/logs. No new FPS, image, control, lifetime or performance acceptance claim.

Nine broader concrete gap IDs remain in IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md; the formatted ordering ID now excludes the connected DWORD subdomain. Continue the remaining original sharp-byte range/domain transfer contract, starting from ShaderBufferRequest::WriteRange and the current compatible_uavs predicate, then the existing buffer-byte store lowering. Formatted readers remain exact-base (pinned buffer_cache.cpp:409 assertion). Prove byte/halfword envelope and logical invalidation separately before admitting sub-DWORD writers; do not weaken DMA/multi-stage/mixed-image/layout/ambiguous-owner guards without their full transfer adaptation. Reuse the existing exact-range GCN fixtures, rather than restarting the global renderer audit. Build/compiler remain permitted; final suite/game/XInput stays deferred to the agreed full-implementation boundary. Full-port goal remains active.


## Active integration checkpoint — 2026-10-17

This section supersedes older active/next instructions below. Build/compiler/link are authorized by the latest user request; tests/game/XInput/UI remain deferred until the complete implementation boundary.

Accumulated sources and required build integration are committed. Separate clean Release built successfully at `72569a5`; full identity, snapshot recovery, source commit contents and logs: [INTEGRATED_RELEASE.md](INTEGRATED_RELEASE.md). EXE SHA256 `ddf89b38fada81c5865d1dfd1d5cb13b052f855ae261ad3804d2da4114a4955a`.

The129 groups now distinguish connected implementation from behavior verified. [IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md) lists concrete known changes as upstream→native→missing semantics and prepared checks separately. Earlier “all129 partial because unrun” statements are historical and superseded. No final runtime PASS or full-port completion is claimed.

Current continuation: verify committed build script from the clean checkout, then resume expanded BC typed-view production work and the explicit remaining code backlog. Full-port goal remains active. Preview24/original Vulkan/saves/user session unchanged.

## Actual texture heap pressure checkpoint - 2026-10-16

Authoritative current section; all earlier current/next sections are historical.
No configure/build/package/compiler/test/GPU/game/XInput/UI execution. All129 groups
remain partial/open; source/Git/hash reviews do not establish runtime correctness/FPS.

original22-path index proof, reviewed worktree versus isolated staged hashes, partial-
commit provenance and residual archive are in pressure-retirement-20261016. The casting/
large-mode inherited integration was not swept into commits. Previous4ab70c5 and its
326-file residual archive remain immutable. SESSION_HANDOFF.md gives the new depth task.


## Readonly history checkpoint - 2026-10-16

Authoritative current section; all earlier current/next sections are historical.
Source-only continuation: no configure/build/package, fixture/test/compiler execution,
GPU/game/profiling/XInput/UI operation. All129 contract groups remain partial/open.

Final documentation/local/remote SHAs and original-index/archive checks are in
F:/PS4Dev/handoff/ordered-writers-20261015/CHECKPOINT_FINAL.json. Historical residual
integration was preserved separately, not swept into these commits. Previous b7129d6
and ordered-stream-20261015 archive remain intact.


## Current ordered streams, native SSBO aliases and readonly extents - 2026-10-15

This section is authoritative; earlier current/next statements are historical.
Source commits d4b70f9,4210e31 and4ef80fc are pushed on fix/mixed-cmask.
No build/configure/package, test/fixture execution, GPU/game, XInput, profiling or UI

Cache-source checkpoint used a separate index and committed only its version line.
Previous checkpoint30f5d19 and evidence cmask-exceptions-20261015 remain intact.


## Current CMASK and ordered-buffer checkpoint - 2026-10-15

SESSION_HANDOFF.md's top section is authoritative; older next-task statements are historical.
Pushed source: e43ebdc (CMASK6/7 INF and canonical NaN, actual raw/typed cast-list checks)
and cbfe500 (one-stage full-range resident formatted reader/writer descriptor ordering).
Read-before-write retains image-to-buffer transfer before invalidation; write-before-read
keeps the buffer version. Early clean-small readonly snapshots remain guarded, including
raw readers preceding the writer. Existing transfer/ownership/fence checks remain.
Source-reviewed only: no build, configure, install, tests, GPU/game/XInput/UI or measurements.
All129 groups remain partial/open. Installed preview24 and selected preview23 are unchanged.
Eight real-GCN cases are authored only; the helper is new, its minimal integration into the
historical untracked attachment fixture is preserved separately and in final-residual.
Evidence/final remote HEAD/index/archive: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/cmask-exceptions-20261015/CHECKPOINT_FINAL.json.
Next production task: guest_compute.cpp early clean-small CPU-byte snapshots retaining
original logical sharp identity and separate native storage; use ordered-formatted/NEXT_SOURCE_TASK.md.
Do not rerun completed format/cache audits. The user execution gate remains active.



## Current packed-float/RGB32 checkpoint - 2026-10-15

6f55ea1 contains only reviewed isolated scheduler candidates; inherited scheduler patches remain dirty. Original22 staged deletions preserved. Evidence scheduler-batch-20261016; no build/test/game execution.

Latest source finding (2026-10-16): CommandScheduler::Submit moves a retirement callback
into by-value Defer after GPU execution; deque allocation failure can destroy its last
resource lease before fence completion. Source-proven failure path, not an observed crash.
The simple copy-before-clear experiment is INCOMPLETE and was removed only after preserving
its exact patch/before/after, with inherited scheduler bytes restored by exact comparison.
Evidence: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/scheduler-retention-20261016/{REVIEW.md,DISPOSITION.md,EXPLORATORY_OWN.patch}.

Next production fix: preallocate a scheduler-owned retirement/resource batch before queue
execution, publish its fence without allocating after ExecuteCommandLists, retain ownership
on Signal/Defer/publication failures, and avoid repeated partially executed callbacks. Review
this before publishing any scheduler fix. The previous submitted BC expansion38b7c95 remains
source-only; its staging uses this existing lifetime contract and has no runtime acceptance.
New partial BC fixture authoring is in progress separately; existing committed expectations
remain unchanged. Build/test/game/GPU/UI execution remains deferred; all129 groups partial.

Current partial BC expansion source WIP: 38b7c95 (2026-10-16), superseding prior next-step
notes below. MatchesReferencePartialBlockExpansion now admits same-address UINT64/128
source to native readonly BC target with matching base4x dimensions/pitch, equal array layers,
source mip count <= target, exact common physical mip offsets/strides/tiling, and every
source copy rectangle fitting its actual BC mip extent. Source bytes form a complete target
prefix. Early source selection, sticky modified history and generic transfer share this
admission. New callback captures one target R: synchronized B iff target pages are GPU
modified, otherwise read_backing_ physical P staged privately. Retile overlays only source I
words into the SAME seed prefix; prefix merges back without changing R-only blocks/tail.
New actual BC ownership is acquired before retiring old I; pins/resources/fences stay.

Independent source review: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/bc-partial-copy-20261016/REVIEW.md. No build,
compiler, tests, game, GPU or UI execution. Failure-path device/submission lifetime and new
GPU contents remain unverified. Old fixtures do not establish partial-copy coverage. Next:
author meaningful unrun controls for UINT24->BC96 levels5 partial-block complement and
UINT32->BC128 extra tail mips, with page-complete valid layer counts and BOTH target-page
GPU-query branches using distinct I/B/P. Use independent GPU readback; do not reconcile guest
source while observing. Check full target compressed bytes, padding, tail, source guards and
parent retirement. Then continue writable selected-view authority and shifted physical aliases.
All129 groups remain partial/open, and installed preview24 remains unchanged.

Latest source WIP 3bfd8ef (2026-10-16), superseding older ownership limits below:
actual native readonly BC storage now retains complete real mip layout even when it cannot
be represented by a complete UINT64/128 chain. Canonical BC-to-UINT matching remains stricter;
selected private UINT prefixes must still match it. No BC UAV, buffer-writer permission,
expanded/linear/volume admission or partial-copy conversion was enabled. Existing backing,
page,64MiB, watch and fence gates remain. Three authored shape controls now distinguish
valid actual BC ownership from invalid complete UINT correspondence; corrupted physical
layout controls still reject. Independent source review and exact patches/hashes:
F:/PS4Dev/handoff/bc-actual-owner-20261016/REVIEW.md. Uncompiled/unrun; no runtime PASS/FPS.

Next production task: add a single target refresh seed R (GPU Bsync iff target-page GPU
modified, physical P otherwise), feed its prefix to RetileBufferVersion, and merge that
prefix back into the same full R before BC upload. Implement explicit physical-prefix and
copy-extent admission from bc-mip-bridge-20261016/NEXT_PARTIAL_BC_COPY_CONTRACT.md first.
Current callback's separate source/target captures must not serve this partial-copy path.
All129 contract groups remain partial/open; tests/build/game/UI remain deferred.

Current source continuation: 179972f (2026-10-16), authoritative over older notes below.
Readonly UINT block-texel views selecting one mip now support nonzero first_mip through an
exact full physical prefix [0..k]. The helper requires first_mip=levels-1, prefix levels
within the BC parent, and identical per-mip pitch/height/offset/slice/tiling/layers and block
geometry. Complete ownership replacement keeps its original reverse-chain guard. The
private child remains dirty/non-authoritative; parent BC allocation, ownership and pending
fence resources survive. Independent source review: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/
bc-selected-prefix-20261016/REVIEW.md. No build/test/GPU/game/UI execution; no runtime PASS.

Remaining: reverse selected-view fixture coverage, writable shared-subresource coherence,
dirty-parent refresh, address-shifted mip/slice aliases, and forward partial BC copies with
the proved shared target B/P seed. Next source change must use NEXT_PARTIAL_BC_COPY_CONTRACT.md
in bc-mip-bridge-20261016; preserve one source version and target padding/tail provenance.
All129 groups remain partial/open. Earlier fixtures are authored/unrun; preview24 unchanged.

92af292 adds a complete output-region GPU readback baseline to the BC mip fixture, with no
guest-memory resolution. Source change is pushed and unrun; review this new delta before
relying on untouched-byte assertions. Prior independent production/fixture review reports are
saved under F:/PS4Dev/handoff/bc-mip-bridge-20261016.

## Selected BC mip view source checkpoint - 2026-10-16

923d637 pushed a readonly selected-mip0 conversion path that preserves the multi-mip BC
parent's authority and lifetime. It is WIP/source-only; the authored fixture oracle still
uses independent GPU readback, but remains unreviewed/unrun and lacks reverse selected-view
coverage. Evidence and exact source snapshot are in
F:/PS4Dev/handoff/bc-mip-bridge-20261016. Original staged network deletions are preserved.


SESSION_HANDOFF.md's top section is authoritative; older next-task entries are historical.
06536f2 and6ded358 are pushed: exact packed-float2/4/8-sample transfers with actual cast lists,
readonly RGB9E5 physical ownership, and readonly RGB32 guest12/host16 transfer with separate
independent-image retention. Page/backing/fence/physical-domain guards remain. Source-reviewed
only, NOT compiled/installed/run. All129 groups remain partial/open. Preview24 stays installed
unchanged; no new FPS or game result. User execution gate remains active.
Evidence and final HEAD/remote/residual recovery: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/packed-float-msaa-20261015/CHECKPOINT_FINAL.json.
Next source task: CMASK6/7 selected +INF conversion in DecodeGuestColorClear; see
rgb32/NEXT_SOURCE_TASK.md. Finite RTZ is done; NaN encoding and format34 clear stay open.



## Current packed-MSAA source checkpoint - 2026-10-15

SESSION_HANDOFF.md's packed-MSAA section is authoritative; older sections are historical.
Source1f43d43 adds finite CMASK6/7 deterministic RTZ,59fdc53 adds packed MSAA independent
versions/retained signed10 words and nonzero packed/sRGB clears; fe51ce4 extends
native sampled16-18 and retained expanded19. Source review only: NOT built/installed/run.
All129 contracts remain partial/open. Preview24 EXE70eeeff04e89 remains installed unchanged;
no new FPS/test/game result. The user test/GPU/game/UI gate remains active.
Evidence/provenance: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/packed-msaa-20261015; final HEAD/remote/residual
recovery hashes are in CHECKPOINT_FINAL.json. Broad dirty integration and22 staged
network deletions remain preserved. Next source task: exact packed-float independent
MSAA format6/34 with actual native castable-format contracts, then existing partial-alias
queue. Do not infer a missing Vulkan feature from its intentional whole-MSAA GC skip.


## Current source checkpoint - 2026-10-15, after preview24

SESSION_HANDOFF.md's complete-port section is authoritative. Source commits35b5de4,
d7d9064,440dd53,ad6808e and e359447 are pushed: stable WAIT_REG_MEM operands, shared typed/raw CMASK clears,
8/16/32-bit independent MSAA transfers with scratch pressure retirement/recreation,
pinned color-write-mask mapping, exact packed-float CMASK6/7, raw RGBA8 MSAA transfer
and nonzero clear with retained resources/fences; stale storage_retired reset on conversion.
Current changes are NOT compiled/installed/run.
Preview24 remains the latest installed executable; no new game/FPS or test results.
The user execution gate remains active. Evidence and pending source follow-ups:
F:/PS4Dev/handoff/complete-port-20261015. Preserve the broad dirty integration and
22 pre-existing staged deletions. Existing129 contract groups remain partial/open.
Next source task: independent packed10/packed16 MSAA reinterpretation through existing
transfer/tiler contracts, with raw guest words/masks and private padding preserved.
Final HEAD/upstream and residual hashes: complete-port-20261015/CHECKPOINT_FINAL.json.


## Latest package — 2026-10-15

Preview24 is built and installed at the user's subsequent request: source a3f1d5e plus
packaged dirty patch, EXE SHA256 70eeeff04e89e604f7f5f6fa33115706bad76550dbbe54eb0cd86f1852c7e8bf.
Release compile/link and static package/discovery checks succeeded. No runtime tests,
game or desktop automation; no new FPS. Selected core/settings and originals preserved.
See SESSION_HANDOFF.md and eop-continuation-20261015/preview24-installed/INSTALLATION.json.
Earlier source-only compilation/install statements below are historical.

## Active continuation — 2026-10-15: source work, execution deferred

SESSION_HANDOFF.md is authoritative. The user stopped ALL test/game execution and
desktop automation until the full transfer is ready for final testing. New backing-write,
PM4 completion, culling, R32 MSAA, shared mixed/uniform CMASK GPU clears and fence changes
are WIP, source-reviewed only; no build/tests after that instruction. Historical326/346
and subsequent targeted results are unchanged. Full parity/world correctness remain open.
Original22 staged deletions retained; source/provenance at
F:/PS4Dev/handoff/eop-continuation-20261015. CMASK source commit 479064d93bd2.
Next: exact raw CB clear-word mapping for more numeric formats/component swaps;
then remaining MSAA/alias/cache contracts. Preserve user execution gate; no new audit.

Source WIP commits:756359c0a410,9960b080783a,f1e68d4,29540d917543,479064d93bd2. Final HEAD/upstream and archive hashes are recorded in eop-continuation-20261015/CHECKPOINT_FINAL.json.


## Active black-frame continuation — 2026-10-14

SESSION_HANDOFF.md active section is authoritative; older priorities/results below are historical.
Source fixes e267eb8, capture metadata24bf8c0, producer/ROP capture 1fb65f7b10fc;
prior integration WIP5b6f47e. All pushed to origin/fix/mixed-cmask, without22 pre-existing staged network deletions.
Stage24/pipeline4/metadata34. Menus recovered; final world remains fog/sky; G-buffer contains player/environment.

c0aa3e4a6fb2de072b29ffa4d0682d5accd9c292,
`wip(dx12): preserve current performance development state` (19 known files).
The following documentation commit is named
`chore(dx12): checkpoint development state for next Codex session`;
its actual SHA/status/upstream outcome are external in CHECKPOINT_FINAL.json.

Full before-state: 253 tracked-change paths/155 new paths, staged+unstaged binary
patches, original index and SHA256 source ZIP at
`F:/PS4Dev/handoff/full-port-emergency-20261013`. Other changes are deliberately
left outside the WIP because broad pre-existing ownership was not re-established.
Final residual patches/manifests and RESTORE.md preserve their exact restoration.
Latest core237/PDB/MAP/dependencies are copied there; preview18/default/older cores,
installed Vulkan and original saves remain. Group126 typed SRV reader C++ links;
shader proof/replay runtime are pending. No completion/FPS improvement claim.
No emergency build, game launch or profiling; unknown PresentMon processes retained.

## Final high-memory verification — 2026-10-11

Initial c31111c -> 7a550c9 residency/pools -> 9527c90 bounded overlap lookups.
Final source 9527c901a50256016072c4b67464946f78061ab1; all four runs use SHA256 db7e55e2e8f070bf3739a2e8aa50bb8b0f67cd2b393cc34a19cb25ccabcc44df.
216/216 final high-memory tests. Same-scene final FPS A/B/C/D:
0.6440 / 0.8400 / 0.7505 / 0.8078; C/A +16.53% observed,
materialization per completed frame -96.91%. One run/mode; no significance claim.
No new visible regression identified; old artifacts remain. Standalone C dev build,
original installation and all 20 saves preserved. Raw evidence/report outside Git.


## 2026-10-11 — bounded residency lookups after measured B run

Parent 7a550c9. B reduced materialization ~97% per completed frame but not average
FPS. Retained mappings made full-map validation scans visible. FirstOverlapping
now bounds ReleaseCpuBufferWatches, NotifyCpuWrite and GPU-owned overlap queries
used by streaming/arena validation. Disjoint interval and containing predecessor
semantics are preserved. Regression fails before (10.24 million candidates), passes
after (10 thousand); 27.958 -> 0.353 ms in the component sample. Final game comparison
remains outstanding; index optimization is not included in this package.

## 2026-10-11 — high-memory implementation checkpoint

- Parent c31111c; single-agent work, dedicated dev profiles and immutable save seed.
- Configurable DXGI-aware cache/arena budget; no upfront allocation, pressure trimming
  respects both completed fences and externally held allocation leases.
- Fixed address-order hot eviction and 64-MiB DMA whole-cache clear in experimental mode.
  Both regressions fail before and pass after (test-before.log / test-after.log).
- High-memory full suite first exposed 160-MiB buffers wasting 256-MiB heaps;
  compact large heaps fix it. suite-high-memory-fixed.log: 215/215, 70.88 s.
- Real GPU-gated eviction test, snapshot/staging content verification, PRT edge,
  zero-budget/live-lease checks added; all previous tests retained.
- Game performance comparison pending; ordinary diagnostic A is archived with its
  source diff, new header, executable hash and per-frame/counter evidence.



## 2026-10-11 — F1–F3 complete, Release world comparison

- Parent 3d14e008aa4313abce0e1bf006d06089d02d2964; implementation 67d0ddc2df0294c9839f769821e7414681d43661.
- F1: CopyBufferBatch passes BufferWrite footprints separately from shader resource envelopes;
  default unknown shader writes remain conservative. Previous dirty union is retained.
- F2: PageWatch::ChangeMode transfers READONLY/NOACCESS under its lock, advances generation,
  preserves retired intervals and never introduces a writable gap. Commit downgrade is
  also protected. Upload snapshots use the exact staged version in cached CPU memory;
  watch establishment validates after protection is installed. Failed commit keeps ownership.
- F3: ValidateGpuBacking checks mapping, committed backing and guest access rights independently
  of CPU reconciliation. GuestBufferAccess is shared production code, not a copied fixture override.
  GuestRasterizer prepares image aliases separately; real CPU reads/uploads/control records
  and unsupported buffer/image conversions retain reconciliation and fences.
- Before -> after: disjoint F1 12288 -> 64 bytes, overlapping union 48 bytes;
  unknown prior writable envelope remains 12288. F2 compared span 4096 -> 0;
  resident A->B commits before CPU 1 -> 0. Logs: f1-before.log, f23-before.log, package.log.
- Production fixture: real CPU stores, 16 concurrent watch transfers, GPU chain/scratch,
  partial/page-edge aliases, unrelated CPU-visible dirty buffer, failed commit/retry,
  rights rejection, PRT hole and unmap/remap. Existing queued faults/rearm/retired-history
  tests remain. Old physical-alias fixture now sends Core's committed mapping notification.
- Native suite 211/211 in 67.40 s; suite-verified.log. D3D12 Debug Layer targeted tests pass.
- Bounded opt-in frame trace excludes blank/repeated frames and observes completion of
  each immutable frame's copy fence (including guest queue dependencies), with 2 ms polling.
  Created / PM4-ready / fence-complete / Present-queued are separate. Queueing is not scanout.
- Same-scene baseline and fixed Release each have two measured world runs; see BENCHMARKS.md.
  The baseline's extra failed loading attempt is retained, not silently discarded.
- Verified launcher: F:/PS4Dev/handoff/coherence-20261011/after-2/Launch-Bloodborne.cmd;
  actual child core in its core/ directory, implementation 67d0ddc, clean at build,
  SHA256 c921b7e819a9c0d557ee23dae5a7f99075776f9a8b7e4f881c0d7e4705b1ccc5.
- Only local commits. Original installed executable and 20 save files verified unchanged.

## 2026-10-11 — recursive buffer reconciliation

- Parent: `ee765f40925fbe7c32aa3ede718161202e6a2a78`, branch `fix/mixed-cmask`.
- Output: containing commit (`git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/codex-progress/FULL_FRAME_PROFILE.md`).
- Proven cause: an outer nonempty resolving_buffers_ made unrelated CheckBacking
  requests call Finish recursively; 1,943 repeated sequences exhausted the worker stack.
- Change: Rasterizer::ResolveGpuBuffers tracks request-local new overlaps; scope cleanup
  preserves outer state and releases this request's entries after success or exception.
- Regression: actual GPU copies, exact bytes/padding, nested backing checks, commit failure
  and retry. Old code fails; fixed code passes. Core built; native suite 208/208, 96.62s.
- Game: original saved-character profile copies, rebuilt baseline/fixed binaries, partial 0.
  Fixed run exits at GXWorker:1 `eboot+0x26b2b0b`; no world/FPS improvement established.
- Evidence, executable hashes and timing limits: FULL_FRAME_PROFILE.md.
- Next: capture original GXWorker fault context and PageWatch ownership/protection.
- User authorized commit/push after verified changes; remote delivery is verified separately.

## Integration checkpoint 2026-10-11

2026-10-11 — parent a824f9f65668d61080d2e90488435589efcd4f90, clean initial tree.
Subject: perf(dx12): bound observed guest buffer reconciliation lookups.
Live GPU-worker samples at ~10,831 mappings motivated lower_bound/predecessor lookup.
New regression covers exclusive boundaries, ownership and preserved data; 208/208
native tests and core build passed. Microbenchmark 26.789 -> 0.366 ms / 10,000 calls.
Three integration runs documented in GAMEPLAY_BASELINE.md; no world-entry improvement.
Commit identity is this entry's containing commit (git log); no push performed.

## PARITY-A01 — 2026-10-10 Vulkan draw-filter precedence

- Input SHA: `e43ba4d`; output: commit containing this entry
  (`git log -1 --format=%H -- native-port/draw_filter_test.cpp`).
- Epic: A. Upstream `Vulkan::Rasterizer::FilterDraw` at the pinned reference revision.
- Adaptation: special color clear/decompress/resolve remains before primitive rejection;
  None now stops GuestRasterizer::DrawInternal before depth/stencil override-copy.
- C++ changes: guest_graphics_state.h, guest_rasterizer.cpp, draw_filter_test.cpp.
- Regression: seven production-classifier cases, including None with stale depth/stencil
  override flags and special CB operations. This is not a full GuestRasterizer execution test.
- Core compiled and linked; full native suite 207/207 passed in 54.09 seconds.
- No game run, new milestone or performance result claimed. End-to-end memory-side-effect
  fixture and deterministic Vulkan/DX12 command comparison remain the next priority.
- Local commit subject: `port(dx12): match Vulkan draw filter precedence`; no push.

## PARITY-E01 — 2026-10-10 scheduler ownership audit

- Input SHA: `774d0951ccb40caf47921856ede9c2446203699e`.
- Output SHA: the commit containing this entry (`git log -1 --format=%H -- native-port/scheduler_lifetime_test.cpp`).
- Epic: E; initial source map for A/B/C/D/F.
- Reference: upstream `0c9ca525b8add53e62b3ccd9c9c2f6ef2ebabbfa`,
  `Scheduler::UploadCommandBuffer/SubmitExecution` upload-before-primary and timeline ownership.
- DX12: `CommandScheduler::CollectTimestamps`, `AcquireContext`, `SubmitCopy`;
  recording callbacks in Rasterizer, GuestRasterizer and GuestTextureCache now return void.
- Confirmed defect: unsubmitted query data was read with an old/zero fence. Regression failed
  at baseline, passed after guarding submission state and collecting before oldest-context reuse.
- No caller used SubmitCopy's zero result; removing it makes the actual completion contract
  explicit without claiming that an observed early-free crash was fixed.
- New test: native_scheduler_lifetime, open/reused timestamp contexts and exact two-copy
  readback through the next direct fence. D3D12 Debug Layer enabled.
- Full native build and tests: 206/206 passed, 64.75 seconds.
- Previous GPU timing inference withdrawn; no new FPS or Bloodborne milestone claim.
- Remaining: draw-filter ordering regression, true command differential replay, full parity audit.
- Next priority: EPIC A DrawInternal PrimitiveType::None before override-copy behavior.
- Push: not performed in this cycle.

## 2026-10-10 — compute copy reconciliation

- Baseline: `01c0374` (`Stabilize partially overlapping DX12 buffer mappings`).
- Scope: opt-in dispatch-stage distributions and counters; page-aligned copy materialization;
  deferred reconciliation for GPU-owned copy destinations; coherence regression coverage.
- Result: copy-shader HLE CPU wall time decreased 5.5% in the controlled steady-state sample.
- Validation: targeted 2/2; full native 205/205; no D3D12 validation errors in the 66-second run.
- Local commit subject: `perf(dx12): reduce measured compute dispatch overhead`.
- Remote push: not performed.

## 2026-10-10 — resource timing and upload submission batching

- Baseline: `5b0f555` (`perf(dx12): reduce measured compute dispatch overhead`).
- Scope: asynchronous D3D12 compute timestamps; buffer preparation/coherence counters;
  deferred-reconciliation coverage; copy-queue upload batching with direct-queue ordering.
- Result: copy submissions decreased 4,046 to 2,678 (-33.8%); resource-binding CPU wall
  average decreased 7.9%; whole-dispatch average was effectively unchanged.
- Validation: targeted 3/3; full native 205/205; no D3D12 validation errors in the game run.
- Local commit subject: `perf(dx12): batch buffer upload copy submissions`.
- Remote push: not performed.

## CMASK-M01 — 2026-10-11

- Input: `7984fed0e789e4ea48af2487c7d1095826aa2c3c`.
- Changes: `GuestColorClearPending`/`MaterializeGuestColorClear` now build a per-layer mixed CMASK plan; zero tiles use a GCN AddrLib-derived pipe-interleaved address, F tiles remain untouched, materialized nibbles become F. `GuestRasterizer::MaterializeColorClear` preserves the original exception and adds only opt-in bounded capture diagnostics.
- Regression: `native_guest_cmask_fast_clear` exact changed/unchanged tile checks, idempotence, untouched layer and actual D3D12 readback; full native suite passes 208/208.
- Core build passes. Bloodborne was tested from cloned/rebased profiles; the audio guest assertion recurred before an additional CMASK-stage proof. No PASS game claim.
## GXWORKER-P01 — 2026-10-11

Final verification addendum: committed code `ab1bf1a47e0ce2a0a3cd8fa528285dcd8a58b066`
reaches world/control beyond 120 s using the delivered dev launcher. The debugger
observes 18 handled original-instruction faults (3 on GXWorker:1), then detaches.
LEVEL 2 established. Pixel correctness and playable performance remain open.
See GXWORKER_PAGEWATCH.md and the external final-verification.json for exact final
duration and executable SHA256. This addendum changes documentation only.

- Input `40a8e683def56160ea110a2d5df1a48a8532c4ce`, branch fix/mixed-cmask.
- Original first-chance game context proves class C retired-range coverage loss;
  short predecessor hides large interval covering a pending valid guest write.
- PageWatch coalesces retirement history and handles newly rearmed generations;
  protection, physical backing reconciliation, fences and recursion guard stay enabled.
- COPY queue texture initial state is corrected after real Debug Layer error 1334.
- Real delayed CPU-fault GPU regression fails before, passes after with exact bytes;
  negative/lifetime/bounded-retry checks pass. Full native suite 208/208, 55.52 s.
- Partial fix reached world/input then crashed; complete fix precommit run reached
  a separate loading mutex wait. LEVEL 1 established; playable performance not claimed.
- GXWORKER_PAGEWATCH.md documents evidence and the final committed-build dev launcher.
  External release/verification manifests capture exact binary hash and launch result.
- Local commit only; no push. Original application and saves unchanged.
